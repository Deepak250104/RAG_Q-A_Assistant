# Natural Language Processing Basics

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in useful ways.

## Core NLP Tasks

### Text Preprocessing
- Tokenization: Breaking text into words, phrases, or other meaningful elements
- Stopword removal: Eliminating common words that add little meaning
- Stemming and lemmatization: Reducing words to their root forms
- Part-of-speech tagging: Identifying the grammatical parts of speech

### Syntax and Parsing
- Dependency parsing: Analyzing grammatical structure and relationships
- Constituency parsing: Identifying phrases and clauses within sentences
- Named entity recognition: Detecting and classifying named entities in text

### Semantic Analysis
- Word sense disambiguation: Determining the meaning of words in context
- Semantic role labeling: Identifying the relationship between predicates and arguments
- Coreference resolution: Determining when different expressions refer to the same entity

### Text Generation and Transformation
- Machine translation: Converting text from one language to another
- Summarization: Creating concise summaries of longer texts
- Question answering: Generating answers to questions based on text
- Text generation: Creating new text based on input or requirements

## Key NLP Techniques and Models

### Traditional Approaches
- Rule-based systems using grammatical rules and dictionaries
- Statistical methods using probabilities derived from text corpora
- Machine learning approaches using feature engineering

### Modern Deep Learning Approaches
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) representing words as vectors
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and variants like LSTM and GRU
- Transformer models and attention mechanisms
- Pre-trained language models (BERT, GPT series, T5)
- Fine-tuning techniques for specific downstream tasks

## NLP Applications

- Virtual assistants and chatbots
- Search engines and information retrieval
- Content analysis and recommendation systems
- Sentiment analysis and opinion mining
- Machine translation services
- Automated content generation
- Healthcare documentation and analysis
- Legal document processing

NLP continues to advance rapidly, with large language models demonstrating increasingly sophisticated capabilities in understanding and generating human language across diverse domains and tasks.
